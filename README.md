## ✨ Features

### 🏠 Home — Instance Hub
Your instances front and center. Launch any profile with one click, track install & download progress in real time, and pin your favorites directly in the sidebar for instant access. Supports loading via short **Share Codes** for collaborative setups.

### 📦 Instances — Full Mod Management
Create isolated instance profiles with custom Java versions, loaders (Vanilla, Fabric, Forge, NeoForge), and resource packs. Browse and install content from both **Modrinth** and **CurseForge** without leaving the launcher.

- Search mods by relevance, popularity, or date
- One-click install with version selection
- Toggle mods on/off without deleting them
- Check for and apply mod updates
- Export instances as `.mrstack` files — drag one onto the launcher to import instantly
- Full console/log viewer per instance

### ⛏️ Bedrock — Minecraft Bedrock Edition
Install and launch Minecraft Bedrock Edition straight from Modstack. The launcher detects existing Store installations, manages updates, and tracks play state automatically.

### 👕 Skins — 3D Skin Manager
Preview your current skin on an interactive 3D model (slim or classic body type), apply new skins via Mojang's API, or inject skins locally for offline play. Cape support with the ability to switch your active cape.

### ⚙️ Settings
Fine-grained control over everything:
- **Launcher:** animations, animated background, hide-on-launch, Discord Rich Presence
- **Game:** window resolution, fullscreen toggle, min/max RAM allocation
- **Storage:** custom install directory with one-click reset to default
- **Bedrock:** separate install path management and uninstall

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| UI Framework | React 19 + TypeScript |
| Desktop Shell | Tauri 2 (Rust backend) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 + HeroUI |
| Mod APIs | Modrinth API + CurseForge API |
| Auth | Microsoft OAuth2 + Mojang API |
| Discord | Discord Rich Presence |
| Skin Preview | skinview3d |
| State Management | Zustand |
| Build Tool | Vite |

The Rust backend is split into focused crates:

- `mc_bootstrap` — classpath, manifest, and JVM rules
- `mc_downloader` — version manifest fetching and asset/file download
- `mc_service` — account, profile, and blocklist handling
- `minecraft-msa-auth` — Microsoft authentication flow

## 📄 .mrstack Format

Modstack uses the `.mrstack` file format for portable instance sharing. Double-clicking a `.mrstack` file (registered as `application/x-mrstack`) will open Modstack and automatically import the instance. You can also export any local instance from the Instances view.

---

## 🔐 Authentication

Modstack supports:
- **Microsoft / Xbox Live** — full OAuth2 flow for official Minecraft Java accounts
- **Offline mode** — local accounts for offline play (no Microsoft account required)
